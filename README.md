# PersonDiaryMicroServices
During this sample I'm trying to handle microservices architecture on DDD principles with .Net Core, Consul, RabbitMQ, Redis and Dapper. 
I've not got enough time for this, that is why most imlemented is Person microservice for now, 
the LifeEvent service will be implemented later.

The legend of sample is following: to implement persons diary, where will be listed his most significant life events 
(very simple domain with two entities)
